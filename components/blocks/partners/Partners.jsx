                We were impressed with Keenethics from the get-go. They really get startups and are
                able to work without perfect project-plans - making clever and reasonable
                assumptions as they go and clarifying when the need arises. Great team, solid
                communication and fast-paced, high-quality development. They really get startups and
                are able to work without perfect project-plans.

                Due to their responsiveness & patience, the collaboration itself progressed smoothly
                from start to finish, resulting in a high quality product & ensuring their continued
                engagement. KeenEthicsâ€™ skill set was exactly what was needed, & despite a language
                difference, communications never suffered.

                Despite the physical distance and never meeting each other in person, KeenEthics has
                built a complicated dairy industry related webapp for us. I found the cooperation in
                the development of this tool good, honest and straightforward.
