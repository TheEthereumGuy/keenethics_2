            <h2>What Is a Dedicated Development Team?</h2>
            <p>Outstaffing is the process of hiring professional software developers to assist you with a project. These specialists work at the premises of their own agency. Meanwhile, your company manages and controls them. The greatest advantage of outstaffing is the simplicity of it. Do you realize the need for more team members on your project? Contact the agency providing dedicated development team and talk to developers they offer. As soon as you say “Deal!”, these specialists can start working on your project at once. Yes, it is that simple.</p>
            <p>Requesting outstaffing services is the way you bring the best talents into your development team without going through the typical HR recruitment and training routine.</p>

            <h2>Do You Need a Dedicated Development Team?</h2>
            <p>
              A dedicated development team is not a one-fits-all solution. The effectiveness of a dedicated software development team depends on project characteristics.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Project size: any</b>
              <br />
              Hiring a dedicated software development team equally suits projects of all sizes, from small to large.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Project duration: any</b>
              <br />
              You can engage in outstaffing at any stage of your project development. It is equally easy for augmented resources to start a new project from scratch or to hop on the existing one.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Project cost: any</b>
              <br />
              Evidently, the cost of your project depends on its scope, timeline, and quality. Yet, it will turn out to be cheaper if you engage in outstaffing rather than outsourcing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Requirements: changing</b>
              <br />
              A dedicated software development team can easily adapt to changing requirements since these specialists should be professional and agile.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Client Control: high</b>
              <br />
              As in the case of project outsourcing, you cannot just leave it alone. If you are engaged in staff augmentation, you need to monitor the project continuously.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Methodology: Agile</b>
              <br />
              Since communication among team members needs to be continuous and requirements may change regularly, Agile Project Management technology is what you need. You can use Scrum, Kanban, XP, or Lean – whatever suits your needs best.
