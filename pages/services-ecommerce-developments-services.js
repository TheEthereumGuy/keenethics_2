        <h2>Ecommerce Industry</h2>
        <p>
          Life is getting busier and faster. People have neither time nor opportunity to spend
          their time shopping for clothes, groceries, electronics, cosmetics, or furniture. It is
          much easier to order food online and get it delivered right to your door. Booking a hotel
          suite and buying tickets for a holiday trip also went 100 percent online.
