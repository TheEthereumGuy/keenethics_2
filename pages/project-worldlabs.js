              <h3>Challenges & Solutions</h3>
              <p>
                When we first started working on the project, it was already in progress. The existing design had to be changed entirely. Stripe and sign-up via social media had not been implemented either. The code needed a great deal of improvement. In less than two months, we prepared the app for the release.
              </p>
              <hr />
                <p style={{ textAlign: 'center', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>Along with minor technical and organizational difficulties, there was one major challenge: WordLabs wanted to be different.</p>
              <hr />
              <p>
                We made a lot of advancements to help them be unique. Yet, there is one feature we are proud of the most.
              </p>
              <p>
                The platform lets organizations launch, promote and manage their own contests. They can appoint external judges to review the ideas and projects of applicants. In this way, competitions are open and fair, each person has an equal chance to prosper, and the hosting company starts working with the most deserving people.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a result of the fruitful cooperation with the WorldLabs team, we developed a powerful one-of-a-kind social media platform. It is focused on business cooperation for start-ups and fledgling businesses. It fosters the exchange and elevation of ideas.
              </p>
              <h3>Our Team</h3>
              <p>
                The project is long-lasting, so about ten expert full-stack developers and QA specialists have been working on it. The team is managed by a proficient Project Manager. UI/UX design is conducted on the client‚Äôs part.
              </p>
              <h3>Technologies</h3>
              <p>
                We have developed both back-end and front-end of this web platform with the use of MongoDB, React, and Meteor.

              <h3>Methodology</h3>
              <p>
                We have been working on this online startup incubator for over two years already. The approach to the development process has changed a few times. Yet, we have successfully adapted the <Link href="/blog/how-to-choose-your-optimal-development-methodology">Kanban</Link> methodology to our needs.

              <h2>What Makes WorldLabs Special?</h2>
              <p>
                WorldLabs is not a typical online business incubator. It does not help every start-up grow. Instead, it supports start-ups and entrepreneurs with unique and innovative ideas.
              </p>
              <img style={{ margin: '30px auto', maxWidth: '250px' }} src="/static/portfolio/worldlabs/explore.png" alt="explore" />
              <p>
                The WorldLabs community is diverse. It unites people from all parts of the world and different professional spheres. There are business owners, social activists, students, and educators. There are large corporations and small start-ups. WorldLabs does not limit the opportunities but gives everyone a chance to thrive.
              </p>
              <img style={{ margin: '0 auto', maxWidth: '300px' }} src="/static/portfolio/worldlabs/network.png" alt="network" />
              <p style={{ marginBottom: '5px' }}>
                The business incubation process is not typical either. Usually, it involves four stages:

                1. ideating<br />
                2. verifying<br />
                3. searching for funding<br />
                4. entering the market
              </p>
              <p>
                WorldLabs describes its business incubation process differently and more comprehensively.
